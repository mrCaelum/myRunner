# myRunner
*C Graphical Programming | Epitech | Tek1*

##### Purpose of the project :
- [x] Create a platform game in 3 weeks

## Build
```
$ make
```

## Usage
```
$ ./my_runner
```

## Maps
All map files are stocked in the `maps` folder.  
I have only pushed the level selection map and the settings map.  
You can create your own map, named `[number].map` in the `maps` directory (`maps/3.map` for exemple).  
A `~.map` file is a simple text file, with some specific caracters that simbolizes games elements.

### List of caracters
- `[space]` = nothing
- **`P`** = player
- **`.`** = coin
- **`~`** = spikes
- **`o`** = eye
- **`D`** = door
- **`B`** = setting button
- **`_`** = floating block
- **`#`** = ground
